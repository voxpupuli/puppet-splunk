#   used for password resets through Bolt Plans.
#
# @param manage_password
#   If set to true, Manage the contents of splunk.secret and passwd.
#
# @param password_config_file
#   Which file to put the password in i.e. in linux it would be
#   `/opt/splunk/etc/passwd`.
#
# @param password_content
#   The hashed password username/details for the user.
# @param secret_file
#   Which file we should put the secret in.
#
# @param secret
#   The secret used to salt the splunk password.
#
# @param service
#   Name of the Splunk Enterprise service that needs to be restarted after files
#   are updated, not applicable when running in agent mode.
#
# @param mode
#   The class is designed to work in two ways, as a helper that is called by
#   Class[splunk::enterprise::config] or leveraged independently from with in a
#   Bolt Plan. The value defaults to "bolt" implicitly assuming that anytime it
#   is used outside of Class[splunk::enterprise::config], it is being used by
#   Bolt
